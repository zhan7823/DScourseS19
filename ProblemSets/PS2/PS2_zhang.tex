\
\\
Second, Python is established in 1991. it is oldest tool for the data science, also, it has the largest amount of users compare to others. it is able to used for data science and general-purpose computing. it is open source.

\
\\
Third, Julia is the newest tool for data science which is established in 2012. it does have too much users due to it is still new. But it is the same as Python which is able to use for data science, general-purpose computing and open source. the advantage for Julia is the speed will faster than Python.
