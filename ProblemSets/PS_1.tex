A couple of reasons why I am in the course. First, I feel that data science is very cool to learn. Users are able to let the computer work by itself. it seems like a magic for me. second, data is the future no matter what kind of industries. third, the career options for a data leaner is very broad. I can work in many different industries to learn something new.

\
For the final project, I may going to do something relate with the alcohol consumption in Oklahoma or something relate with the new alcohol low in Oklahoma.

\
I am not expect to be professional after this class, but I hope I can be more familiar with data science and more practised with all the software we learned. 

\
After I graduate from school, I am interesting in being a data analyst.
